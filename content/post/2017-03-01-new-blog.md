I am starting a new blog mostly because I want to have a place to share information about:

- My experiences using R packages to do particular analyses
- My own R packages that I am working on
- Using R for reproducible research in the form of R Markdown documents, blogs, books, github, packages, etc.

I have some older work in the form of old blog posts and presentations and papers that I will share here, and I will also post about stuff that I am working on going forward. I hope that I can share some useful information for other R users.
